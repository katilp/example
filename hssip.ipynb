      "After talking with my teachers about the question, we concluded that as an immediate way to benefit my school and as a result of that also my region, we would hold an assembly where I would hold a presentation of my stay at CERN and what I learned there. After the stay I would also increase my peers’ interest in physics by answering questions they have about the science conducted at CERN and telling them about my experience of seeing one of the world’s largest and most recognised physics laboratories. This way they would have a way to find out what it actually means to work as a scientist in a large research institute.    Further down the road, I would also take what I learned in CERN with me to the university and possibly even do some research of my own there related to particle physics or other fields studied at the research facility or even start working in the field in my region.\n",
      "Anna pisteet3\n",
      "The benefit of my stay at CERN would mean a lot to our high school. The fact that a small high school can get a student into a program like this would definitely inspire the students to take courses on mathematics and physics. It would also increase the amount of students in general (as it will advertise and bring attention to the school). In a small school it isn't always certain that these advanced courses on math and physics are arranged as there may be too few students to take them. By showing the students that you don't only use the subjects at hand only at school, you can inspire them to try the subjects. And as more people try it, the more people keep studying it and even more innovative heads come together to solve the problems of mathematics and physics.\n",
      "Anna pisteet4\n",
      "A student from our school has never been in a program like this, so I’d have the chance to bring back a large amount of new experiences from CERN. I will be participating in FY7, the particle physics course, which will likely be taught after the internship. During the course I could share the experiences with the class. Our school sometimes invites quests, usually former students, to speak to current students. In this manner I could continue telling about the stay even after graduating and maybe get them more excited about the subject as well.    Rajamäki High School also has both a website and accounts in social medias, e.g. Instagram, where we would publish stories and pictures from my time there. The school is also beginning to co-operate more and more closely with Nurmijärven Yhteiskoulu, another public high school in the area, which means that via sharing the information with this other school two schools would benefit. Because Nurmijärvi is not a particularly large area and anything unusual is welcome, local newspapers would probably be happy to report about me staying there as well.\n",
      "Anna pisteet5\n",
      "After visiting CERN I will certainly recommend this project and CERN as an educational opportunity to others.     I will give an oral presentation in my school. I have also been negotiating with the local newspaper about writing an article of this visit.     We have a lot of physics enthusiastics in Hyvinkää mostly because of two international companies employing people with high-level competence in physics.\n",
      "Anna pisteet6\n",
      "I discussed about the benefits of my stay at CERN with my physics teacher, Panu Viitanen (who actually is at CERN the moment I’m writing this). In our curriculum the very first physics course is about the universe and particle physics. Our plan is to share my experiences and some of the things I’ve learned during my stay with the first grade students. This would hopefully increase the general interest towards physics and science. Especially those already interested in the topic would be reminded about the possibility of actually visiting CERN.    It is also likely that during my stay I will learn things that could in some way be transferred to our school-specific physics courses for those who are interested. For a few years our school has organized physics workshops for the students of a nearby comprehensive school school (Käpylän peruskoulu / Käpylä comprehensive school). Those have usually lasted a few hours each during which they have been presented some interesting physics topics. The visitors have been especially interested in questions regarding the universe. So far the feedback has been great and it would be interesting to try to find a way of teaching them about particle physics as well.\n",
      "Anna pisteet7\n",
      "Our school could give more information to others about CERN. If I get to CERN my school would also get reputation like this schools student got a visit to CERN and that may attract more students to seek a studying place at our school and that will motivate some students to study physics. I could also keep a blog or a vlog with co-operating with other finnish students about my stay at CERN and that could be seen in Finland or, if made in English, around to globe. That would make CERN look good and if done properly, students could get good rwputation around the globe. My visit at CERN could motivate first class or second class students to study more physics and pursue a career in physics. I could go and have a lecture in other schools about CERN and my blog would be visible to everyone who is interested.\n",
